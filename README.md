    by running `php artisan down` from the root of your installation. This isn't
    required but can help prevent problems if users are on your site during the
    upgrade.
- download the latest version of the code from GitHub and copy the code to
    your server however you normally do so - via FTP, git pull, continuous
    integration deployment, etc.
- navigate to https://<your-site.com>/upgrade and follow the instructions on
    screen
- the upgrade page will run database migrations, update configuration
    settings, etc as needed for the new code version.

## Testing

To run the application tests, you can run the following from your project root:

```sh
# If the testing db does not exist yet, please create it
touch database/database.sqlite
# Run the test suite
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

This will run the feature tests that hits the database using the `sqlite`
database connection.
